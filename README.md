# Sorting Algorithms

This is a python program that is an extention of my search and sorting algorithm program, which can be found in my searchSort repository. This program retains the same sorting requirements from the java program. The purpose of this program is to run each of the four different sorting algorithms 100 times on a two-dimentional array (100 rows x 100 columns), and record the runtime for each of the 100 iterations of the four sorting algorithms. The runtimes will be stored into a csv file, and a plot will be created and outputed to a jpg file containing a line graph for the four sorting algorithms.  

##  Purpose

This program is not associated with any computer science courses at Sac State. The purpose of this program was to test my ability to translate code from one programming language to another. In addition, I wanted to gain practice using the pandas and matplot libraries, and learn to output data to csv file and familiarize myself plotting data as well.

##  Unit Tests

Since the program is made to run once and accpets no user inputs, there are no units tests besides presenting what the output of the program should be. 

The plot output should mirror the following:

The first 25 runtimes for each sorting algorithm in the csv file should mirror the following:
